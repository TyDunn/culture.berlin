  <h1>So, where were you?</h1>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">Yeah, as I was saying, it was at that point in my life that I figured things out</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">At what point? I asked.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">I don’t know. I never bothered to ask. You sure ask a lot of questions though. Shouldn’t you be hanging out with some kids your own age?</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">Don’t change the subject. You never said what you figured out!</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">To stop asking questions.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">That’s easy for you to say. You have already made it through the Great Filter. You have already loved and lossed. And you have already been on so many adventures</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">You will too. You just need to have some patience and to wait to experience them. Otherwise, they’ll come and go without you really noticing and then you might as well have stayed home</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">What adventures am I on? I am eating breakfast with some cryptic old guy, and to be honest, I am not even sure you are real. Old people are like not supposed to be with young people like me right now. Like I could fucking kill you, man, without even knowing it. You should be at home.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">Ecclesiastes 3:11. He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man’s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end... and the pancakes are too good here to pass up.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">I have already been through the ICU. I can’t get it again, right?</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">Fuck. I got to stop getting so high. The Egg has somehow become the omelette and I ended up investing in some strawberry farm in Paraguay last night.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">Just shut up and eat your pancakes</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">We sat silently. I could feel that he had given everything he had already. He was a broken man, as all men seemed to become at some point in their lives.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">I cut out parts of me and gave them to others. It was a choice.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">That thinking has gotten you this far, but if you want to go further, you are going to have to jump. Belief starts where the search for truth ends.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">You have got to stop writing the story of where you are going so much. You can quickly process information and take eleven steps forward, but you are leaving everyone else behind and the world ends up moving in a different direction. You are exiting into your individual experience and cutting out the others. This comes at a cost, and I don’t think you are willing to pay that price...</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">Earth to Major Tom. Please come back to reality. The waitress wants to know if you want more coffee</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">Uh, no, thanks</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">He shifted all of his attention from me to her and then back to me.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">I am surprised you are not more confident.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">What do you mean?</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">You have something to say. You have a microphone. Why not at least hear what it sounds like for your voice to come through the speakers?</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">If it’s such a good idea, then why aren’t you saying anything? When I speak, I don’t know if I am doing it to seek attention or to make a connection, but I do question the expression. I question if I want the world to reshape me like it does when you put yourself out there.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">But you also get to reshape the world. Your imagined realities are felt by people other than you.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">He could tell I was getting tired of his usual bullshit</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">How’s that girl you have been seeing?</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">Which one? It was hard to remember what I had told him last and how things have evolved since then.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">I wasn’t aware there were multiple.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">There isn’t. I just forgot you knew about her. She doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, but we still have a drink every now and then at the bar.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">If you still see her now and then, then maybe not?</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">I don’t know. I don’t think she would be able to articulate it, but I think she groks that I am going to infinity and that scares her. Space and time are going to be warped by gravity and that uncertainty seems to show you what you are made out of when you strip away all of the clothes and makeup and jewelry.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 30px;">Now, look who has become the space oddity. What do you know about infinity, son? There is more to come, but it will only reveal itself with time.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">I thought you said that I have eternity in my heart.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">The phone on the other end clicked off.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">“Who was that?”, she asks.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-left: 30px;">Uhh. Just a guy that I … looking around ... that I used to write jokes with.</p>
