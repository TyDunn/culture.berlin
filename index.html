<h1>Detroit & Berlin</h1>

<p>"Kraftwerk were influenced by what he called the "adrenalized insurgency" of Detroit artists of the late '60s MC5 and the Stooges."</p>

<p>"Techno was created by three musicians from Detroit, often referred to as the 'Belleville three' (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson & Derrick May), who fused the repetitive melodies of Kraftwerk with funk rhythms.[80] The Belleville three were heavily influenced by Kraftwerk and their sounds because Kraftwerk's sounds appealed to the middle-class blacks residing in Detroit at this time."</p>

<p>"In exploring Detroit techno's origins writer Kodwo Eshun maintains that "Kraftwerk are to techno what Muddy Waters is to the Rolling Stones: the authentic, the origin, the real."</p>

<p>"Derrick May identified the influence of Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music in commenting that "it was just classy and clean, and to us it was beautiful, like outer space. Living around Detroit, there was so little beauty... everything is an ugly mess in Detroit, and so we were attracted to this music. It, like, ignited our imagination!"</p>

<p>"These early Detroit techno artists additionally employed science fiction imagery to articulate their visions of a transformed society."</p>

<p>"What distinguishes Detroit Techno from its European variants is the way it more directly works the interface of funk and futurism ... but the desire to play up the genre's futuristic side often means the second half of the equation gets dropped."</p>

<p>"The club scene created by techno in Detroit was a way for suburban blacks in Detroit to distance themselves from "jits", slang for lower class African Americans living in the inner city. "Prep parties" were obsessed with flaunting wealth and incorporated many aspects of European culture including club names like Plush, Charivari, and GQ Productions, reflecting European fashion and luxury, because Europe signified high class. In addition prep parties were run as private clubs and restricted who could enter based on dress and appearance. Party flyers were also an attempt to restrict and distance lower class individuals from the middle class club scene."</p>

<p>"The three artists all contribute to the discourse of Afrofuturism through their re-purposing of technology to create a new form of music that appealed to a marginalized underground population. Especially within the context of Detroit, where the rise of robotics led to a massive loss of jobs around the time these three were growing up, technology is very relevant. The process "took technology, and made it a black secret."</p>

<p>"The sound is both futuristic and extraterrestrial, touching on the "otherness" central to Afrofuturist content. According to one critic, it was a "deprived sound trying to get out."[17] Tukufu Zuberi explains that electronic music can be multiracial and that critics should pay attention to "not just sound aesthetics but the production process and institutions created by black musicians."</p>

<p>'The first wave of Detroit techno differed from the Chicago house movement, with the former originating in Detroit's suburban black middle class community. Teenagers of families that had prospered as a result of Detroit's automotive industry were removed from the kind of black poverty found in urban parts of Detroit, Chicago, and New York. This resulted in tensions in club spaces frequented by ghetto gangstas or ruffians where signs stating "No Jits" were common. Suburban middle class black youths were also attracted to Europhile culture, something that was criticized for not being authentically black. Schaub's analysis of Underground Resistance valued "speaking out of the perspective of the hood than about providing new visions of identity formation for people in the hood"'</p>

<p>'Identity politics in Detroit techno is focused mostly on race relations. Throughout the creation of techno there was this constant and strong "progressive desire to move beyond essentialized blackness". Even though the classist nature of techno avoided the artists and producers to separate themselves from the urban poor, especially in the first wave, it helped them make metropolitan spaces the subject of their own vision of different, alternative societies. These alternate societies aimed at moving beyond the concepts of race and ethnicity and blend all of them together. The early producers of Detroit techno state in multiple different occasions that the goal was to make techno just about music and not about race. As Juan Atkins said, "I hate that things have to be separated and dissected [by race] ... to me it shouldn't be white or black music, it should be just music"'</p>

<p>"The first wave of Detroit techno had peaked in 1988–89, with the popularity of artists like Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Blake Baxter, and Chez Damier, and clubs like St. Andrews Hall, Majestic Theater, The Shelter, and the Music Institute."</p>

<p>"In mid-1988, developments in the Detroit scene led to the opening of a nightclub called the Music Institute (MI), located at 1315 Broadway in downtown Detroit. The venue was secured by George Baker and Alton Miller with Darryl Wynn and Derrick May participating as Friday night DJs, and Baker and Chez Damier playing to a mostly gay crowd on Saturday nights. The club closed on 24 November 1989, with Derrick May playing "Strings of Life" along with a recording of clock tower bells. May explains: It all happened at the right time by mistake, and it didn't last because it wasn't supposed to last. Our careers took off right around the time we [the MI] had to close, and maybe it was the best thing. I think we were peaking – we were so full of energy and we didn't know who we were or [how to] realize our potential. We had no inhibitions, no standards, we just did it. That's why it came off so fresh and innovative, and that's why...we got the best of the best." Though short-lived, MI was known internationally for its all-night sets, its sparse white rooms, and its juice bar stocked with "smart drinks" (the Institute never served liquor)."</p>

<p>"Following German reunification and the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, free underground techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin, and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established. East German DJ Paul van Dyk has remarked that techno was a major force in reestablishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period"</p>

<p>"Producers from Detroit, frustrated by the lack of opportunity in their home country, looked to Europe for their future livelihood."</p>

<p>"Developments in American-produced techno between 1990 and 1992 fueled the expansion and eventual divergence of techno in Europe, particularly in Germany. In Berlin, following the closure of a free party venue called Ufo, the club Tresor opened in 1991. The venue was for a time the standard bearer for techno and played host to many of the leading Detroit producers, some of whom relocated to Berlin. By 1993, as interest in techno in the UK club scene started to wane, Berlin was considered the unofficial techno capital of Europe."</p>

<p>"In 1993, the German techno label Tresor Records released the compilation album Tresor II: Berlin & Detroit – A Techno Alliance, a testament to the influence of the Detroit sound upon the German techno scene and a celebration of a "mutual admiration pact" between the two cities.'</p>

<p>"Europe may have the scene and the energy, but it's America which supplies the ideological direction...if Belgian techno gives us riffs, German techno the noise, British techno the breakbeats, then Detroit supplies the sheer cerebral depth."</p>

<p>'Detroit techno had maintained its integrity throughout the rave era and was pushing a new generation of so-called intelligent techno producers forward. Simon Reynolds suggests that this progression "involved a full-scale retreat from the most radically posthuman and hedonistically functional aspects of rave music toward more traditional ideas about creativity, namely the auteur theory of the solitary genius who humanizes technology.'</p>

<p>'Even the Detroit-based company Ford Motors eventually became savvy to the mass appeal of techno, noting that "this music was created partly by the pounding clangor of the Motor City's auto factories. It became natural for us to incorporate Detroit techno into our commercials after we discovered that young people are embracing techno." With a marketing campaign targeting under-35s, Ford used "Detroit Techno" as a print ad slogan and chose Model 500's "No UFO's" to underpin its November 2000 MTV television advertisement for the Ford Focus.'</p>

<p>'Dessen ungeachtet wird der Detroiter Techno-Sound oft als Brücke zwischen US-amerikanischem House und europäischer Elektronik angesehen und gilt damit insbesondere in den USA, nicht nur aufgrund seines Namens, als Frühform und direkter Vorläufer der späteren Techno-Musik.'</p>

<p>„Techno hat an verschiedenen Orten zu verschiedenen Zeiten stets etwas anderes bedeutet. Ursprünglich tauchte der Begriff im Zusammenhang mit Kraftwerk auf. Techno als Musik, die mit den neuesten technologischen Maschinen hergestellt wurde: Computermusik, elektronische Musik. Danach stand Techno für das, was wir heute Industrial oder Electronic Body Music nennen, später für einen neuen Sound aus Detroit. Wenn wir heute von Techno reden, meinen wir vor allen Dingen „Technohouse“, die Fusion der amerikanischen House-Beats mit den europäischen Industrial-Sounds, die seit Anfang der 1990er-Jahre die Partys dieser Welt erreichten und eine Bewegung erzeugten, die nach wie vor zur wichtigsten ‚Move‘ zum Ende des Jahrtausends wurde.“</p>

<p>"Die weitgehend textfreie, manchmal auch melodiefreie Musik eröffnet in ihrer Abstraktheit unterschiedliche Interpretationsmöglichkeiten"</p>

<p>"Nach der Wende standen viele Häuser und Industriehallen im Ostteil der Stadt leer, hatten keine geklärten Besitzverhältnisse und boten somit viel Raum für neue Ideen, weswegen hier meist die ersten Clubs entstanden. Die Aufbruchstimmung vieler Neu- und Ostberliner förderte die Entwicklung der neuen Musikrichtung und ihrer Infrastruktur stark. Frühe Techno-Clubs, die kurz nach dem Mauerfall entstanden und die Szene bundesweit beeinflussten, waren das Planet, das E-Werk, der Tresor und der Bunker. Aufgrund der nicht vorhandenen Sperrstunde konnten die Veranstaltungen in Berlin länger gehen als in anderen Regionen."</p>
