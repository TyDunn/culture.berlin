  <p>"Berlin was very much influenced by the Allies after World War II and their cultural politics as well as the overall cold war situation that separated the city and its citizens and still hampers attempts to find a common identity."</p>
  <p>"In fact, a lot of cultural politics to this day is about contested ideas of collective memory and finding a sense of identity for Berlin and a reunited Germany."</p>
  <p>"Culture was the first act in Berlin after the Second World War. The Russian commandant gave back theatres permission to play on May 16, 1945, eight days after the end of war. Over the next couple weeks, concerts, cinemas, and theatre performances resumed. The Russians were very keen on getting culture back to the people, in a city that was destroyed to 40 percent, and the other three Allies followed shortly."</p>
  <p>"Berlin retained its special status as a military occupied zone and territory under Allied supervision (and kept that status until reunification on 3 October 1990). When Easy Germany was founded in the Soviet sector on 7 October 1949, East Berlin became its capital. From then on, the two halves of the city become intricately linked with the social systems of their respective state governments and have been massively subsidized as ‘showcases’ of their respective political-economic ideologies."</p>
  <p>"In the 1950s, West Berlin was economically weak and 50 percent of its annual budget needed to be subsidized by West Germany. In addition, the city received significant financial aid from the United States through the Marshall-Plan.
  <p>Meanwhile, in East Germany, the strong orientation on labour and people led to many new cultural infrastructures and a network of institutions that organized cultural life. Clubs, for example, were seen as a crucial element in ‘cultural mass work’ and an alternative to churches, pubs, and families, as politicians saw the family eroding and wanted the state to take responsibility in educating its citizens."</p>
  <p>"During a period of extreme Cold War tension, the East German government decided on August 13, 1961 to build a wall to keep residents of East Berlin from defecting in droves to West Berlin."</p>
  <p>"A stronger political focus on culture emerged as a solution to keep people in West Berlin and the ‘capitalist island alive’. A major policy intervention was to lift the curfew in bars and clubs. As a consequence, a flourishing nightlife developed very much influenced by the Allies and their music styles. There were many clubs for jazz, rock’n’roll, beat music but also British and French clubs. And later, the city marketing began to advertise West Berlin as a 24/7 tourist destination with slogans such as ‘Berlin nonstop’ or ‘Berlin, continuously open’."</p>
  <p>"It was forbidden to criticize the political system or living conditions in East German. This led to a severe crisis in 1976 when the government expulsed a famous singer and subsequently many artists choose to leave for West Germany. Despite the prevailing trope of ‘artistic isolation’ in East Germany in the literature, East German artist, as part of the intellectual elite had much exchange with West Germany, travelled a lot, have been part of international exhibitions and Biennales and well aware of developments in the western arts world through illicit but also official sources."</p>
  <p>"East Berlin became a home for many artists who did not wanted to follow official arts policy and started to build up autonomous galleries or reading groups in their flats or ateliers that ‘were more experimental and not officially sponsored’. Most of these activities were concentrated in Prenzlauer Berg – a neighbourhood that similar to Kreuzberg’s redevelopment plans in West Berlin should have been demolished and build with new socialist high rises as on the outskirts of East Berlin. As a consequence, housing was easy available in this neighbourhood and attracted many artists to establish their cultural niche there."</p>
  <p>"In the 1980s, both cities breeded alternative scenes that were tolerated – and in the case of West Berlin were sometimes publicly supported following an integrative approach in cultural policy that tried to combine support for cultural institutions with some project funding for new independent and non-institutionalised artistic initiatives. For example, the Senate funded critical off-theatre groups such as the Schaubühne or Grips Theatre and later funded their own houses as West Berlin became a laboratory of alternative cultures, social and political groups through its peculiar population mix."</p>
  <p>"After the Fall of the Wall in 1989 and the subsequent reunification, one cultural system almost disappeared overnight while the other claimed sole and exclusive interpretation of arts and culture in the city. With the reunification of Germany in October 1990, the cultural atmosphere in the city resembled the chaotic appeal of a society and a city in transition, Berlin was often describes as a ‘wild west land’. Because of its excessive supply of abandoned space, Berlin became a unique opportunity structure for cultural experiments and innovations. Berlin was full of ‘voids’ – holes, wastelands, brown field sites and vacant plots, particularly in inner city area due to the decline of the industrial base as well as the lack of redevelopment under the East German government."</p>
  <p>"There was an ‘emptiness that asked for definition and identity’ and the concept of the ‘void’ has become associated with Berlins cultural scene. The development of the city’s dynamic music subcultures and vivid cultural scenes has been indissociable from this availability of such vacant and abandoned places and has given rise to a varied form of temporary artistic and cultural uses."</p>
  <p>"Since the turn of the millennium, Berlin with its comparatively low rents and living conditions saw a high influx of artists and creative industries business which has been reflected in the growing economic importance of Culture and Creative Industries that became marketed as the ‘Creative City Berlin’. However, Berlin as a ‘Creative City’ was imagined, marketed and supported by economic development and rather less by cultural policy-makers who concentrated on consolidating the high arts cultural infrastructure under the given budget cuts and household constraints."</p>
  <p>"The major objectives of Berlin’s cultural policy agenda, as of 2015, can be summarized as supporting excellence in arts and artistic production and cultural vitality of the city, safeguarding lively heritage (historical buildings and architectural design), developing cultural participation and inclusion (different entry prices), providing cultural education (through libraries, music schools etc) and facilitating cultural diversity (opening up of funding and institutions for migrants)."
  <p>"Unlike in Paris or London, the primary responsibility for Berlin’s cultural policy and the support of the cultural infrastructure lies with the Senate, not the national government. Nevertheless, this specific structure results in shared responsibilities with the boroughs and the federal government and gives rise to constant struggles around different sets of ideas on what is of cultural value to whom and what makes objectives for cultural policy in the city."</p>
  <p>"Berlin is highly dependent on funding from European Union’s structure and investments funds such as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) that are often used within the boroughs to support artistic projects, maintain workspaces or stimulate the professional development of artists."</p>
  <p>"More than 10 percent of Berlin’s working population work in the different sectors of the culture and creative industries. However, due to massive real estate investments, the public sale of properties, the recent economic growth and the high inward migration (in the last two years Berlin gained a net migration plus of almost 100.000 people) the cost of living has risen dramatically in Berlin and there are less and less suitable spaces for artistic work and performances available."</p>
  <p>"Starting in 2014, every tourist who spends a night in a hotel in Berlin now contributes one Euro per night for the support of the city’s cultural infrastructure."</p>
  <p>"The city still faces the continuing rise of rents, a growing social housing crisis and has still to cope with its massive debt that prevents major investments and significant budget changes. Artists fear the further loss of crucial workspaces in the inner city areas."</p>
  <p>"The ongoing efforts to recreate a united city, after more than 40 years of political and physical division, are a challenge, especially while, at the same time, having to deal with remnants of the past (e.g. the German empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazism, Cold War separation) that have left their marks on the city’s material and symbolic infrastructure."</p>
  <p>"While globalization processes gave cities a new strategic importance, Berlin lacked the economic infrastructure to gain the necessary ‘connectivity’. Only in cultural terms Berlin has gained worldwide recognition and been able to attract a global art and culture crowd. Therefore, culture has not only become important for Berlin, it has an existential meaning as the most important asset."</p>
  <p>"The author believes a stronger focus on a diverse and decentralized cultural infrastructure is needed that leads away from the high arts provision in the inner city and facilitates more the cultural development of whole Berlin and acknowledges its growing ethnically diverse population."</p>
